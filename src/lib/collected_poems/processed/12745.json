From my hand\nHer clasped hand slips to meet the grasp of thine;\nHere eyes that flamed with love, at thy command\nStare stone-blank on blank air; her frozen heart\nForgets my presence. Teach me who thou art,\nVague shadow sliding 'twixt my friend and me.\nI never saw thee till this sudden hour.\nWhat secret door gave entrance unto thee?\nWhat power in thine, o'ermastering Love's own power? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","cleaned":"what hast thou done this friend mine thou cold white silent stranger my hand her clasped hand slips meet the grasp thine eyes that flamed with love thy command stare stone blank blank air her frozen heart forgets my presence teach me who thou art vague shadow sliding twixt my friend and me i never saw thee this sudden hour what secret door gave entrance unto thee what power thine o ermastering love s own power ","pattern":[null,"what","hast","thou","done","this","friend","mine","thou","cold","white","silent","stranger","my","hand","her","clasped","hand","slips","meet","the","grasp","thine","eyes","that","flamed","with","love","thy","command","stare","stone","blank","blank","air","her","frozen","heart","forgets","my","presence","teach","me","who","thou","art","vague","shadow","sliding","twixt","my","friend","and","me","i","never","saw","thee","this","sudden","hour","what","secret","door","gave","entrance","unto","thee","what","power","thine","o","ermastering","love","s","own","power",""],"pi":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,32,0,15,0,0,0,13,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,13,6,0,42,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,57,1,0,22,0,0,27,0,0,69,0]}
