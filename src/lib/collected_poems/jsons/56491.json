{"id":"56491","title":"Magical Nature","author":"Robert Browning","copyright":null,"content":"Flower, I never fancied, jewel, I profess you!\nBright I see and soft I feel the outside of a flower.\nSave but glow inside and jewel, I should guess you,\nDim to sight and rough to touch: the glory is the dower.Â  \nYou, forsooth, a flower? Nay, my love, a jewel,\nJewel at no mercy of a moment in your prime!\nTime may fray the flower-face: kind be time or cruel,\nJewel, from each facet, flash your laugh at time!","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/56491/magical-nature"}
