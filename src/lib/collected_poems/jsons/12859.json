{"id":"12859","title":"Twilight","author":"Ernst Toller","copyright":null,"content":"In early evening the cell flares up.\nThin shadows slide down the gray walls.\nHe who cries out in mutiny exhausts into a dream.\nThe brown stillness sweeps over like a gentle wave.\n\nAnd often a frosted light fills the choked room.\nFigures beckon you to the spiritless circle\nwhere the dance of the heavy coats dissolves into silence,\nwhere dawn breaks into a ringing of bells. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/12859/twilight"}
