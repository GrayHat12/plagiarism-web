    "content": "Where does my shadow go \nWhen I'm asleep?\nDoes it rest till daylight?\nOr does it creep\nAway, to live nine lives\nOut on the town?\nMeeting other shadows — \nGetting it down?\n\nYou might think I'm crazy,\nBut I'm concerned.\nMy good reputation\nHas been hard earned.\nI don't want my shadow \nBeing unfair —\nLanding me in trouble\nWhen I'm not there!\n________________________\n",
