McGee,\nAll compliment thee,\nThe hope of the land,\nOn your lecture so grand.\n\nThough that is your fort,\nOh, give us the sport\nOf an hour of your chat ;\nThen we'll laugh and grow fat.\n\nFor none but the vile\nCould e'er cease to smile\nWhen near to thee,\nSo brilliant and free.\n\nPlant of Green Erin's isle, \nLong in Canadian soil, \nMay you take deep root \nAnd bear much noble fruit.\n\nOur hopes were in vain,\nAlas ! he is slain\nBy a crankish hand,\nThe flower of the land. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/20360/lines-on-t.d.-mcgee"}
