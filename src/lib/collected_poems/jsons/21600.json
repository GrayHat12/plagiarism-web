{"id":"21600","title":"Book Of Love - One More Pair","author":"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe","copyright":null,"content":"LOVE is indeed a glorious prize!\nWhat fairer guerdon meets our eyes?--\nThough neither wealth nor power are thine,\nA very hero thou dost shine.\nAs of the prophet, they will tell,\nWamik and Asia's tale as well.--\nThey'll tell not of them,--they'll but give\nTheir names, which now are all that live.\nThe deeds they did, the toils they proved\nNo mortal knows! But that they loved\nThis know we. Here's the story true\nOf Wamik and of Asia too. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/21600/book-of-love---one-more-pair"}
