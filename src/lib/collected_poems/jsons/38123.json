{"id":"38123","title":"Reconciliation","author":"Walt Whitman","copyright":null,"content":"   WORD over all, beautiful as the sky!   Beautiful that war, and all its deeds of carnage, must in time be         utterly lost;   That the hands of the sisters Death and Night, incessantly softly         wash again, and ever again, this soil'd world:   ... For my enemy is dead--a man divine as myself is dead;   I look where he lies, white-faced and still, in the coffin--I draw         near;   I bend down, and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the         coffin. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/38123/reconciliation"}
