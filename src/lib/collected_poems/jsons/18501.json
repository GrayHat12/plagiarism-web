(From The German Of Mahlmann)","author":"Henry Wadsworth Longfellow","copyright":null,"content":"Allah gives light in darkness, \nAllah gives rest in pain, \nCheeks that are white with weeping \nAllah paints red again. \n\nThe flowers and the blossoms wither, \nYears vanish with flying fleet; \nBut my heart will live on forever, \nThat here in sadness beat. \n\nGladly to Allah's dwelling \nYonder would I take flight; \nThere will the darkness vanish, \nThere will my eyes have sight. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/18501/allah.-(from-the-german-of-mahlmann)"}
