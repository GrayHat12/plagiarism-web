Confession sprig!   In the bouquet I give you place also--I bind you in,   Proceeding no further till, humbled publicly,   I give fair warning, once for all.\n   I own that I have been sly, thievish, mean, a prevaricator, greedy,         derelict,   And I own that I remain so yet.\n   What foul thought but I think it--or have in me the stuff out of         which it is thought?   What in darkness in bed at night, alone or with a companion? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/38078/o-bitter-sprig!-confession-sprig!"}
