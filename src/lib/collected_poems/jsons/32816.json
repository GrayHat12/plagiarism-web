{"id":"32816","title":"Life From The Lifeless","author":"Robinson Jeffers","copyright":null,"content":"Spirits and illusions have died,\nThe naked mind lives\nIn the beauty of inanimate things.\n\nFlowers wither, grass fades, trees wilt,\nThe forest is burnt;\nThe rock is not burnt.\n\nThe deer starve, the winter birds\nDie on their twigs and lie\nIn the blue dawns in the snow.\n\nMen suffer want and become\nCuriously ignoble; as prosperity\nMade them curiously vile.\n\nBut look how noble the world is,\nThe lonely-flowing waters, the secret-\nKeeping stones, the flowing sky. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/32816/life-from-the-lifeless"}
