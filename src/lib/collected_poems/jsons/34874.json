{"id":"34874","title":"Dryads","author":"Siegfried Sassoon","copyright":null,"content":"When meadows are grey with the morn \nIn the dusk of the woods it is night: \nThe oak and the birch and the pine \nWar with the glimmer of light. \n\nDryads brown as the leaf \nMove in the gloom of the glade; \nWhen meadows are grey with the morn \nDim night in the wood has delayed. \n\nThe cocks that crow to the land \nAre faint and hollow and shrill:\nDryads brown as the leaf \nWhisper, and hide, and are still. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/34874/dryads"}
