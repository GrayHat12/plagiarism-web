Cry the challenge through the Jungle!\nHe that was our Brother goes away.\nHear, now, and judge, O ye People of the Jungle--\nAnswer, who can turn him--who shall stay?\n\nMan goes to Man! He is weeping in the Jungle:\nHe that was our Brother sorrows sore!\nMan goes to Man! (Oh, we loved him in the Jungle!)\nTo the Man-Trail where we may not follow more. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/33578/the-spring-running"}
