{"id":"14534","title":"God","author":"Gamaliel Bradford","copyright":null,"content":"Day and night I wander widely through the wilderness of thought, Catching dainty things of fancy most reluctant to be caught. Shining tangles leading nowhere I persistently unravel, Tread strange paths of meditation very intricate to travel.\n\nGleaming bits of quaint desire tempt my steps beyond the decent. \nI confound old solid glory with publicity too recent. \nBut my one unchanged obsession, wheresoe'er my feet have trod, \nIs a keen, enormous, haunting, never-sated thirst for God \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/14534/god"}
