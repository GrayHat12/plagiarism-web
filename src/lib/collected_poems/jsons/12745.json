{"id":"12745","title":"Youth And Death","author":"Emma Lazarus","copyright":null,"content":"What hast thou done to this dear friend of mine,\nThou cold, white, silent Stranger? From my hand\nHer clasped hand slips to meet the grasp of thine;\nHere eyes that flamed with love, at thy command\nStare stone-blank on blank air; her frozen heart\nForgets my presence. Teach me who thou art,\nVague shadow sliding 'twixt my friend and me.\nI never saw thee till this sudden hour.\nWhat secret door gave entrance unto thee?\nWhat power in thine, o'ermastering Love's own power? \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/12745/youth-and-death"}
