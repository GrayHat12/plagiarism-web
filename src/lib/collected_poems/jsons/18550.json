{"id":"18550","title":"Columbus. (A Translation From Schiller)","author":"Henry Wadsworth Longfellow","copyright":null,"content":"Steer, bold mariner, on! albeit witlings deride thee,\nAnd the steersman drop idly his hand at the helm; \nEver, ever to westward! There must the coast be discovered,\nIf it but lie distinct, luminous lie in thy mind.\n\nTrust to the God that leads thee, and follow the sea that is silent;\nDid it not yet exist, now would it rise from the flood.\nNature with Genius stands united in league everlasting;\nWhat is promised to one, surely the other performs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/18550/columbus.-(a-translation-from-schiller)"}
