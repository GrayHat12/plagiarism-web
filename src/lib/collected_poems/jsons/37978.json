{"id":"37978","title":"Beginning My Studies","author":"Walt Whitman","copyright":null,"content":"   BEGINNING my studies, the first step pleas'd me so much,   The mere fact, consciousness--these forms--the power of motion,   The least insect or animal--the senses--eyesight--love;   The first step, I say, aw'd me and pleas'd me so much,   I have hardly gone, and hardly wish'd to go, any farther,   But stop and loiter all the time, to sing it in extatic songs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/37978/beginning-my-studies"}
