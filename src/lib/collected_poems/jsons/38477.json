{"id":"38477","title":"I've Got My Fief","author":"Walther von der Vogelweide","copyright":null,"content":"I've got my fief, you world! A fief at last!\nI shall not fear the February blast,\nand petty barons can be flattered less. \n\nThe noble king has handed me heart's-ease:\na cozy winter hearth, a summer breeze.\nThe neighbors won't act haughty any more\nand make sour faces, as they did before. \n\nI've scrounged, and had small cause for gratitude,\nso full of grumbles that my breath was bad.\nNow I can sing! The king has made me glad! \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/38477/i've-got-my-fief"}
