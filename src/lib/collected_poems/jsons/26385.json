{"id":"26385","title":"New Moon","author":"Marina Ivanovna Tsvetaeva","copyright":null,"content":"Over meadow stands new moon,\nOver boundary of dew.\nCome, we'll make a friend of you,\nDear, distant, alien.\n\nIn the day I hide, am quiet.\nMoon above - I have no might!\nI rush on this lunar night\nTo the shoulder of beloved.\n\nI'll never ask me, 'Who's he?'\nAll to know, your lips will say!\nHugs are rude but in the day,\nIn the day the fit is funny.\n\nIn the day, torn by a demon proud,\nWith a smile on lips I lie.\nNight, though.. Darling, far away..\nCrescent stands above the wood! \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/26385/new-moon"}
