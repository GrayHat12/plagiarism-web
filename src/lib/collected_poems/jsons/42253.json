{"id":"42253","title":"Lucy","author":"William Wordsworth","copyright":null,"content":"She dwelt among the untrodden ways\nBeside the springs of Dove,\nMaid whom there were none to praise\nAnd very few to love:\n\nA violet by a mossy stone\nHalf hidden from the eye!\n--Fair as a star, when only one\nIs shining in the sky.\n\nShe lived unknown, and few could know\nWhen Lucy ceased to be;\nBut she is in her grave, and, oh,\nThe difference to me! \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/42253/lucy"}
