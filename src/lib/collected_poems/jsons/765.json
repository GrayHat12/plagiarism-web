    "content": "SOUL, heart, and body, we thus singly name,\nAre not in love divisible and distinct, But each with each inseparably link'd. One is not honour, and the other shame,\nBut burn as closely fused as fuel, heat, and flame.\n\nThey do not love who give the body and keep\nThe heart ungiven; nor they who yield the soul, And guard the body. Love doth give the whole; Its range being high as heaven, as ocean deep,\nWide as the realms of air or planet's curving sweep. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
