{"id":"42742","title":"A Sea Burthen","author":"Cicely Fox Smith","copyright":null,"content":"A ship swinging\nAs the tide swings, up and down,\nAnd men's voices singing, -\nEast away O! West away!\nAnd a very long way from London Town!\n\nA lantern glowing\nAnd stars looking down,\nAnd the sea smells blowing, -\nEast away O! West away!\nAnd a very long way from London Town!\n\nLights in wild weather\nFrom a tavern window old and brown,\nAnd men singing together, -\nEast away O! West away!\nAnd a very long way from London Town! \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/42742/a-sea-burthen"}
