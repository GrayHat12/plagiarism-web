{"id":"37359","title":"The Empty Boats","author":"Vachel Lindsay","copyright":null,"content":"Why do I see these empty boats, sailing on airy seas? \nOne haunted me the whole night long, swaying with every breeze, \nReturning always near the eaves, or by the skylight glass: \nThere it will wait me many weeks, and then, at last, will pass. \nEach soul is haunted by a ship in which that soul might ride \nAnd climb the glorious mysteries of Heaven's silent tide \nIn voyages that change the very metes and bounds of Fate â€” \nO empty boats, we all refuse, that by our windows wait! \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","url":"https://www.poetry.net/poem/37359/the-empty-boats"}
