In heaven there’s piannas, with keys a mile wide
And I can hear them tinkling in that familiar style of stride
In heaven there’s piannas, they’re tonking in the stars
Tatum, Burt, Garner and Bach, between Mercury and Mars

In heaven there’s piannas, with keys a mile wide
And I can hear them tinkling in that familiar style of stride
When I get my pianna there, I know what I will do
I’ll play it all night and day my friends and toot toot it for you
