I snatched two poppies 
From the parapetâ€™s ledge, 
Two bright red poppies 
That winked on the ledge. 
Behind my ear 
I stuck one through, 
One blood red poppy 
I gave to you. 

The sandbags narrowed 
And screwed out our jest, 
And tore the poppy 
You had on your breast ... 
Down - a shell - O! Christ, 
I am choked ... safe ... dust blind, I 
See trench floor poppies 
Strewn. Smashed you lie.
