I called for Cupid's help today to melt your icy heart.
But he would not (or could not) even play his part.

His quiver was quite empty, with not one arrow left.
He shrugged his dimpled shoulders, leaving me bereft!

He wouldn't look me in the eye; he wore an ugly frown.
He acted in the strangest way - flying upside down!

He really was no help at all. I hardly think it fair.
I've come to the conclusion that Cupid doesn't care!
