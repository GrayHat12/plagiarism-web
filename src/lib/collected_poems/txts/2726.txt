The Editor wrote his political screed 
In ink that was fainter and fainter; 
He rose to the call of his country's need, 
And in spiderish characters wrote with speed, 
A column on "Cutting the Painter". 
The "reader" sat in his high-backed chair, 
For literals he was a hunter; 
But he stared aghast at the column long 
Of the editorial hot and strong, 
For the comp. inspired by some sense of wrong 
Had headed it "Gutting the Punter".
