Where does my shadow go 
When I'm asleep?
Does it rest till daylight?
Or does it creep
Away, to live nine lives
Out on the town?
Meeting other shadows — 
Getting it down?

You might think I'm crazy,
But I'm concerned.
My good reputation
Has been hard earned.
I don't want my shadow 
Being unfair —
Landing me in trouble
When I'm not there!
