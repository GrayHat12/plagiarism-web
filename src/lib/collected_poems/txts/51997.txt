Don't search love in others
Don't expect the truth
That is pure
Be sure
You will disappoint
Just devote your love
To others
A smile spread, on your face
For everyone
Live for others
Help for others
Die for others
That is real happiness
That is true love
That is pure life
But it is very hard
To understand
To do all that
It is the naked truth
It is the naked truth
