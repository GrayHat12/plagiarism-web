The moon is alone in the sky 
As thou in my soul; 
The sea takes her image to lie 
Where the white ripples roll 
All night in a dream, 
With the light of her beam, 
Hushedly, mournfully, mistily up to the shore. 
The pebbles speak low 
In the ebb and the flow, 
As I when thy voice came at intervals, tuned to adore: 
Nought other stirred 
Save my heart all unheard 
Beating to bliss that is past evermore.
