I'm dusting to rock n' roll music,
my hips are swaying to the beat,
the radio is turned on louder
as I shuffle my feet.

I'm dusting to rock n' roll music,
singing at the top of my voice,
windows are opened and theÂ neighbors don't have a choice.

I'm dusting to rock n' roll music,
tossing the rag into the air,
pretending my family is an
audience at the State Fair.

I'm dusting to rock n' roll music,
till the entire house glows,
from light fixtures to cookie jars,
the music and Pledge flows.
