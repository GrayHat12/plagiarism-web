Until last night I had never been alone,  never bereft of sleep

Until last night I had never been afraid,  never afraid to dream

Until last night my thoughts were in stone,  indecision a foreigner sure

Until last night my will had been staid,  my conscience both steadfast and pure
 —until last night
