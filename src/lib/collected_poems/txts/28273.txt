Life in the world is short,

Why shoulder an unnecessary load

Of worldly relationships? 

Thy parents gave thee birth in the world,

But the Lord ordained thy fate.

Life passes in getting and spending,

No merit is earned by virtuous deeds.

I will sing the praises of Hari

In the company of the holy men,

Nothing else concerns me.

Mira's Lord is the courtly Giridhara,
