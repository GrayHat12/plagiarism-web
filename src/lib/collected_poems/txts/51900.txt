You cannot forget me
You cannot throw me out
From your heart and mind
Even you kill me in your heart
I will remain in your life
Until your journey of life ends
Your memories
Will make me alive
Within your entity
You loved me
You still love me
I am your life
Your way of destiny
Find the way of the approach
Break all obstacles
To reach me
Or let me visit and see
Before you lose everything
Time does not come back
Just one call
Can remove every wall
You and I become one
For good and all.
