My sweetheart's dainty lips are red, 
With ruby's crimson overspread; 
Her teeth are like a string of pearls; 
Down her neck her clustering curls 
In ebony hue vie with the night, 
And over her features dances light. 

The twinkling stars enthroned above 
Are sisters to my dearest love. 
We men should count it joy complete 
To lay our service at her feet. 
But oh what rapture is her kiss! 
A forecast 'tis of heavenly bliss!
