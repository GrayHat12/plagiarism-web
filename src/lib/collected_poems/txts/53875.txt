As the sun needs not
Advice and permission,
From a candle, to shine
Upon the universe
Similarly, as such
Quality subject,
Requires not
The acknowledgment
From one else
Since it knows
God gifted nature of it
In other words,
As a philosopher
Knows its philosophy
As the prophet stays
Aware of its prophecy
I am also
As a traveller in that way,
Spraying the best wishes
For all without the desire
For a reward in return
Thus,
No human-authority is there
That can prevail
My role of the character
