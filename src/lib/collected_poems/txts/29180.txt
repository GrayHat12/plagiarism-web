I.
The odour from the flower is gone
Which like thy kisses breathed on me;
The colour from the flower is flown
Which glowed of thee and only thee!

II.
A shrivelled, lifeless, vacant form, 
It lies on my abandoned breast,
And mocks the heart which yet is warm,
With cold and silent rest.

III.
I weep,--my tears revive it not!
I sigh,--it breathes no more on me;
Its mute and uncomplaining lot
Is such as mine should be.
