The Shepherds' adoration,
the  Magi's vision,
one star traversing night,
angelic host announce 
the birth of Royal Babe,
in peace and meekness wrapped.

This silent night,
long promised gift of light,
to lift the veil from blinded eyes
and make known to waiting hearts
that God with men abides.

May the light of Christ shine in you,
with healing in its wings.
