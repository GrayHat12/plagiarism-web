Tall trees along the road, 
I never saw you 
Last year in summertime. 
He came before you 
With his blue eyes. 
Warm wind along the road, 
I never knew you 
Last year in summertime. 
We could outdo you 
With our hot sighs. 
This year, oh wind and trees, 
We're friends together. 
Else should I be alone 
In this sweet weather 
Beneath fair skies.
