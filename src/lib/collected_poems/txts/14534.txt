Day and night I wander widely through the wilderness of thought, Catching dainty things of fancy most reluctant to be caught. Shining tangles leading nowhere I persistently unravel, Tread strange paths of meditation very intricate to travel.

Gleaming bits of quaint desire tempt my steps beyond the decent. 
I confound old solid glory with publicity too recent. 
But my one unchanged obsession, wheresoe'er my feet have trod, 
Is a keen, enormous, haunting, never-sated thirst for God
