I've got my fief, you world! A fief at last!
I shall not fear the February blast,
and petty barons can be flattered less. 

The noble king has handed me heart's-ease:
a cozy winter hearth, a summer breeze.
The neighbors won't act haughty any more
and make sour faces, as they did before. 

I've scrounged, and had small cause for gratitude,
so full of grumbles that my breath was bad.
Now I can sing! The king has made me glad!
