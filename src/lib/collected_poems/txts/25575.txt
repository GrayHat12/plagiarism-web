My darling lies down in her soft white bed, 
And she laughs at me. 
Her laughter has flushed her pale cheeks with red. 
Her eyes dance with glee. 
My darling lies close in her warm white bed, 
And she will not rise. 
I will shower kisses down on her sleepyhead 
Till she close her eyes. 
Gioja's no happier fresh from the South. 
But my kisses free 
Will straiten the curves of this teasing mouth, 
If it laughs at me.
