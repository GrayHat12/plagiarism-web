Allah gives light in darkness, 
Allah gives rest in pain, 
Cheeks that are white with weeping 
Allah paints red again. 

The flowers and the blossoms wither, 
Years vanish with flying fleet; 
But my heart will live on forever, 
That here in sadness beat. 

Gladly to Allah's dwelling 
Yonder would I take flight; 
There will the darkness vanish, 
There will my eyes have sight.
