Writing about life…  he was powerless over death,  life was what he was good at

Death, a combination  of all he would never understand  and all he would never accept

It was a major failing,  never to bring closure or a period  to the end of his sentence

Along a road predestined,   mirrored by the face of denial,   redemption unreflected—beyond his view
